Welcome!

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Geography and a minor in GIS and Geomatics from the University of Guelph. Currently, I am pursuing a Master's of Geomatics for Environmental Management (MGEM) in which I am expanding my skills in spatial analysis, remote sensing, coding and statistics. I am also working with a sustainable forestry company to better understand wildfire modeling in British Columbia.

When I am not studying, I enjoy collecting rocks, hiking, cooking and swimming.
